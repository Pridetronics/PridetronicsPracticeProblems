Create a playlist class that allows you to add songs, remove songs, and print all of the songs in the playlist.
The songs (represented as Strings) should be stored in an ArrayList of strings, and the ArrayList should be apart of the class as an instance variable.
The addSong method should take in a string and add it to the classes' ArrayList.
The removeSong method should take in a string and remove that song from the classes' ArrayList.
The printSongs method should loop through the classes' ArrayList and print out each song.
